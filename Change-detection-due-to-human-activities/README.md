# Change Detection Due to Human Activities

## Overview

"Change Detection Due to Human Activities" is a project focused on identifying and analyzing changes in geographical areas that can be attributed to human activities. This project utilizes satellite imagery and advanced image processing techniques to monitor and assess environmental changes, urban expansion, deforestation, and other forms of land-use change over time.

## Features

- **Urban Expansion Monitoring:** Analyze and detect urban growth patterns over time.
- **Disaster Response and Recovery:** Monitor areas affected by natural disasters and evaluate recovery progress.
- **Environmental Conservation:** Track changes in forests, wetlands, and other natural resources.
- **Infrastructure Development:** Assess the development and expansion of infrastructure projects.
- **Agricultural Monitoring:** Monitor changes in agricultural land use and crop patterns.
- **National Security:** Support in identifying potential security threats by detecting unauthorized activities.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
  - **Backend:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Harshbailurkar/Change-detection-due-to-human-activities.git
    ```
  - **Frontend:**
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Harshbailurkar/Change-Detection-frontend.git
```
3. **Install dependencies:**
    - **Backend:**
      ```bash
      cd backend
      pip install requirements.txt
      ```
    - **Frontend:**
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of both backend and frontend.
    - Add necessary API keys, database credentials, and other configurations.

5. **Start the application:**
    - **Backend:**
      ```bash
      cd backend
      flask --app app run
      ```
    - **Frontend:**
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm run dev
      ```

## Usage

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Use the integrated APIs (Google Earth Engine, Sentinel Hub) to gather satellite images of the region of interest over different time periods.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Perform image preprocessing using OpenCV or other libraries to enhance the quality of the satellite images for better analysis.

3. **Change Detection:**
   - Apply deep learning models or traditional image processing techniques to detect changes in the geographical area over time.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Visualize and analyze the detected changes to derive insights regarding urban expansion, deforestation, or other human-induced activities.

5. **Reporting:**
   - Generate reports and dashboards to present the findings in a user-friendly manner.
