          Human activities, ranging from deforestation and urbanization to
          industrial pollution, have a profound and often detrimental impact on
          our planet. These changes not only affect biodiversity and ecosystems
          but also contribute to broader issues such as climate change and
          resource depletion. Unfortunately, tracking and quantifying these
          impacts in a timely and accurate manner has been a significant
          challenge.
